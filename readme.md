# Description

Add the level of the soul contained in <u>purchased or looted soul gems</u>. This will not work 
with empty soul gems which were filled by trapping souls. This is due to the fact that the localization key for these gems is identical whether it's filled or not.

## Install

- Manually download [MagicLoader](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1966?tab=description) **1.6+** and extract it to:
    - Steam: `~\Oblivion Remastered\MagicLoader\`
    - GamePass: `~\The Elder Scrolls IV- Oblivion Remastered\Content\MagicLoader\`
- Download and extract your flavour of the mod
- Run* MagicLoader.exe* and click `Do Magic.`
- Launch the game.

## Uninstall

- Delete `SoulGemsContent.json` from `~\OblivionRemastered_*\Content\Dev\ObvData\Data\MagicLoader\`
- Delete contents of: `\OblivionRemastered_*\Content\Paks\~mods\MagicLoader\`
- Run `MagicLoader.exe` and click `Do Magic` if you have other mods that depend on it, skip this step if not.
- Launch the game.

## Update
- Overwrite *SoulGemsContent.json* in `\OblivionRemastered_*\Content\Dev\ObvData\Data\MagicLoader\`
- Run `MagicLoader.exe` and click `Do Magic`
- Launch the game.

## Compatibility
- Should work with anything that doesn't overwrite my `FullNames_Edit` changes.
- If another mod changes the name or doesn't correctly reference these same items using their `LOC_FN` names.

## Notes
- You must re-run [MagicLoader](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1966?tab=description) **1.6+** if I send out any updates to apply them!
- Safe mid-playthrough, but ALWAYS make backups when adding new mods!
- Vortex should be able to put my mod in the correct place for you with the `install` button, but you still need to manually install [MagicLoader](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1966?tab=description) and inject the files after installing it.

- GRUmod for the list of locations found in his UE4SS version [Quest Dungeons Marked (.ESPless)](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/3560).
- RareMojo for the mod description I shamelessly copied from [Tools First - Inventory Sorting](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/964) .
